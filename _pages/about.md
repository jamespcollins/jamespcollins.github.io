**I am an environmental social scientist and geographer** studying how communities adapt to emerging compound hazards through governance and population change. My doctoral work focuses on how adaptation governance shapes migratory responses to flooding. I am training in mixed methods to investigate climate change adaptation and population change to inform community responses and planning.

**Currently**, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm advised by Dr. Miyuki Hino and study planning, populations, disasters, and climate adaptation. I'm affiliated with the UNC Flood Hydrology and Hazards Lab, the Carolinas Collaborative on Climate, Health, and Equity (a NOAA Climate Adaptation Partnership), and the American Geophysical Union Thriving Earth Exchange.

**Prior to doctoral studies**, I earned undergrad degrees in environmental science and government from the University of Texas and worked for the City of Austin as an applied geographer and data analyst. I hail from Central Texas. Tacos, live music, and oak-juniper canyonlands give me life.

**Contact.** I'm happy to connect over my research, graduate school advice, or other inquiries.
