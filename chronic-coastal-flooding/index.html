                        <p>Chronic coastal flooding, sometimes called "high-tide flooding" or "sunny day flooding," is when water comes onto land outside of a major event, like a storm surge from a hurricane <cite>(O'Donnell et al. 2024; Gold et al. 2023)</cite>. While sometimes seen as only a nuisance, chronic coastal flooding can disrupt daily life, cause economic losses, and damage property <cite>(Hino et al. 2019; Moftakhari et al. 2017)</cite>.</p>
                        <p>To understand how chronic coastal flooding is already impacting rural communities, researchers in the <a href="https://tarheels.live/sunny/" target="_blank" title="A joint research effort between researchers at NC State Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering and UNC Chapel Hill Department of City and Regional Planning">Sunny Day Flooding Project</a> are studying a collection of communities in eastern Carteret County, North Carolina, known as Down East, North River, Merrimon, and South River.</p>
                        <p>We have placed five real-time flooding sensors throughout Carteret County. Four sensors are placed Down East (North River Bridge, Davis, Sea Level, and Cedar Island stretch) and one in Beaufort (Front Street). These sensors take photos of street conditions and measure water level at the road. We've used these sensors to measure the number of days roads have been inundated by chronic coastal flooding.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, in June and July 2024 we interviewed people familiar with these areas about their experiences of chronic coastal flooding. We also asked people how they are dealing with it at home, work, and in their communities. We interviewed people both as residents and in their positions in education, agriculture, parks and conservation, public safety, and utilities.</p>
                        <p>We found that (1) chronic coastal flooding is impacting communities now, (2) people are accommodating current risk and can tolarate more flooding, and (3) flooding risk tolerance is more senstive to frequency than depth and (4) is entangled with voluntary immobility.</p>

                            <p>We interviewed people who live and work in eastern Carteret County about their experiences of chronic coastal flooding and how they are dealing with it in their day-to-day lives. We completed 16 interviews with residents and 6 interviews with "local experts" in education, agriculture, parks and conservation, public safety, and utilities.</p>
                            <p>Our interviews included residents of Beaufort, Cedar Island, Davis, Gloucester, Harkers Island, Marshallberg, Sea Level, Straits, and Williston. Our respondents were also familiar with Merrimon, Morehead City, North River, and Stacy.</p>

                        <p>By and large, we heard that people are aware chronic coastal flooding is happening. Several respondents noticed flooding regimes are changing and becoming more frequent.</p>
                        <p>Using our sensors, we have found that some roadways Down East were at least partially inundated <b>over 100 days over a yearlong period</b>.

                        <p>Although these coastal communities have a longstanding heritage of living near, with, and on water, this type of flooding is driving people to shape their schedules, behaviors, and environments around accommodating water in new places &mdash; "in the collards," as folks would say.</p>

                        <p>Residents of Down East are already taking steps to accommodate flooding. <b>Accommodating risk</b> means taking measures that allow continued use of flood-prone areas <cite>(Doberstein, Fitzgibbons, and Mitchell 2019)</cite>. These strategies include changes to the built environment and changes to daily routines.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to the built environment, most residents had at least considered elevating their home, and about half had already done so. Other evidence of accommodation we observed included elevated planter beds, shingles laid out where water stood in driveways, containers or tractor trailers kept as dry storage, and new ditching.</p>
                        <p>In terms of daily routines, most residents said they stay home during flooding to avoid driving through salt water, which rusts components faster than fresh water. A few respondents who work in Morehead City said they have stayed at hotels and with friends in town when flooding on parts of US-70 and NC-12 cuts them off from home. A few respondents described benefits coming from flooding, including better birding in Cedar Island National Wildlife Refuge and walking through shallow water along quieter neighborhood streets.</p>
                        <p>In general, the actions people take to prepare for more severe hurricane-driven flooding, like home elevations and keeping extra supplies, are protective for chronic flooding as well.</p>

                        <p>We also asked people about how they would tolerate more flooding in the future. <b>Flooding risk tolerance</b> is how much flooding &mdash; depth, frequency, and extent &mdash; someone can accept before they become concerned or take further action <cite>(Tonn et al., 2020)</cite>. Preliminary results suggest residents feel their current adaptations and accommodation strategies will suffice for deeper flooding, but more frequent flooding would be problematic.</p>
                        <p>Many residents felt their high-clearance vehicles, elevated or higher-elevation homes, and rural lifestyles would not be heavily impacted by plausible scenarios of deeper flooding &mdash; usually discussed as a foot or less. However, many residents said if flooding were to occur more regularly, about once a week for some or once a month for others, they would have to reconsider their schedules and/or living arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Chronic tidal flooding may be prompting people to move, although we only heard of one such case, and other family factors were also at play. By and large, most people said chronic flooding did not influence their consideration of whether to stay or leave.</p>

                        <p>We observed strong voluntary immobility among our respondents, which is tied up with flooding risk tolerance. Although <b>voluntary immobility</b> is simply the active choice to stay were one currently lives and works, it is often overlooked in research <cite>(Schewel 2020)</cite>. When asked how long they wanted to live here, many residents said they wanted to die in their current home. The active choice to live with friends and relatives on land and waters with ancestral ties means people are deeply motivated to overcome the challenges of flooding.</p>
                        <p>Regional economic trends intersect flooding risk tolerance and voluntary immobility. Declining economic opportunities mean working-age residents increasingly commute to larger towns and cities, exposing people to flooding roads. The development regime is oriented towards coastal vacation-style homes, which means young adults who grow up and are trying to make a life in rural areas face difficulties building new flooding-resistant but modest family homes.</p>
                        <p>Social and demographic trends also relate to tolerating flooding and staying put. The population has grown older as young people move away for jobs and are priced out of housing. Some older residents noted they will need to move away for elder care, since robust services are not available where they live. Without intergenerational care, people may be less able to withstand the steady impacts of chronic flooding.</p>

                        <p>The people of rural communities in eastern Carteret County have longstanding connections to these places &mdash; to each other, to the land, and to the waters of Core Sound, North River, Adams Creek, and more. They have weathered and responded to pressures from injurious public policy, hurricanes, and private development, all while maintaining strong local and regional identities and customs.</p>
                        <p>It is easier to notice changes that occur quickly and dramatically &mdash; a new inlet cut by a hurricane, the closure of a fish factory, the consolidation of schools. Chronic coastal flooding is not a fast or dramatic change, but the small ways it impacts daily life can add up over time and, without accommodation and adaptation, create new pressures on movement, livelihoods, and aging.</p>
                        <p>By documenting how chronic coastal flooding is happening, experienced, and thought about at this point in time, we intended to give these communities a reference point in their conversations about the future. We are indebted to these communities for the time, stories, and experiences they shared with us. We present these initial findings with the hope that these communities maintain and strengthen their agency over where and how they live. We will continue to work with these communities to do so.</p>
                        <p>But for now, we're mommicked. &#10070;</p>
